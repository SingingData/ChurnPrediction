# ChurnPrediction
Multi-input model to predict churn of a subscriber in a financial services business

Business Problem
For a service business, there are two ways to drive growth: grow the number of new customers, or increase the lifetime value from the customers that you already have by retaining more of them. Improving customer retention requires the ability to predict which subscribers are likely to cancel, and to intervene with the right retention offers at the right time. Recently, the use of deep learning algorithms that learn sequential product usage customer behavior to make predictions have begun to offer businesses a more powerful method to pinpoint accounts at risk. This understanding of an account’s churn likelihood allows a company to act to save the most valuable customers before they churn.
 
Managing churn is fundamental to service businesses. The lifetime value of the customer (LTV) is the central measure of business value for a subscription business, with churn as the central input. It’s often calculated as Lifetime Value = margin * (1/monthly churn). Reducing monthly churn in the denominator increases the LTV of the customer base. With increased LTV for the customer base comes increased profitability, and with that increased profit comes the economic support to increase marketing activity investment in growing customer acquisition, completing a virtuous cycle for the business.
